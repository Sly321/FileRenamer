Renaming files in a textdocoment.

You choose your Path and get the Files and Directories listed in a textbox.

You can configure files (files only currently) and save, they will copied with their new name into a folder named 'copy'.
That's it so far for the first release.

Leave ideas and hints for my read/write problem on files, i would appreciate it.
